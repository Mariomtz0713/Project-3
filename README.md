# Project-3
Mario Martinez | Diana Ibarra | Isaac Campos | Joe Montecinos

- In this project we collected flight data leaving from the San Antonio International Airport and looked to analyze popluar destination routes as well as favorable airlines.

## Instructions to fully launch [WEBSITE](https://mariomtz0713.github.io/Project-3/)
Our complete data is not stored online and will need to run the following steps to get all charts displayed properly.
- Run the extract.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook to pull and upload data into a mongodb database. (Note this only needs to be done once)
- Make sure to have "flask_cors" installed in your terminal.
- Open a terminal window, cd into the app.py file, and run the following command: python app.py
- Everytime the page is launched this will need to be done.

Only then will the data generate (view example below).
